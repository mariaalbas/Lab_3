This repository contains a single Python script with a class containing all the methods that have been requested for this seminar, which are a total of 4. 

In the upload of the Aula Global you can find a folder named _Output files_ which contains the input video BBB.mp4 and all its versions resulting from the different operations applied in the methods. It is uploaded there since its size is bigger than the requested to upload it in Github.
